VipinMI2024

Overview
VipinMI2024 is a collection of machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing projects showcasing various techniques and datasets. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and HTML reports covering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, NLP, and statistical analysis. Projects range from classification tasks (e.g., Titanic survival prediction, loan approval) to regression (e.g., house price prediction, wine quality) and text processing (e.g., NLTK-based analysis).
Projects
The repository contains the following projects, each represented by a Jupyter notebook or HTML report:

Titanic Dataset (Titanic_Dataset_2.ipynb)

Predicts survival on the Titanic using classification techniques.
Explores features like age, sex, and class.


Diamond Dataset (Diamond_dataset_3.ipynb)

Analyzes diamond prices using regression models.
Features include carat, cut, clarity, and color.


House Price Prediction (House_price_4.ipynb)

Regression analysis to predict house prices.
Likely uses datasets like Boston Housing or similar.


Boston Housing Dataset (Boston_housing_dataset_5.ipynb)

Regression task to predict housing prices in Boston.
Employs features like crime rate, rooms, and accessibility.


Loan Approval Dataset with K-Means (loan_approval_dataset_k_means_9.ipynb)

Applies K-Means clustering to analyze loan approval data.
Explores patterns in applicant features.


Decision Tree (Decision_Tree_10.html)

HTML report of a decision tree model for classification.
Likely applied to one of the datasets in the repository.


Wine Quality (wine_quality_11.html)

Regression or classification task to predict wine quality.
Uses features like acidity, sugar, and alcohol content.
Visualizations and model performance metrics included.


Random Forest (Random_Forest_12.html)

HTML report of a random forest model for classification or regression.
Applied to a dataset like wine quality or Titanic.


NLTK Analysis (NLTK_13.html)

NLP project using NLTK for text processing.
Tasks may include tokenization, sentiment analysis, or text classification.


Bag of Words (BOW_14.html)

NLP project implementing a Bag of Words model.
Likely used for text classification or feature extraction.


Bell Curve Analysis (Bell_15.html)

Statistical analysis, possibly exploring normal distribution or data visualization.
May include hypothesis testing or distribution fitting.


ANOVA (anova.ipynb)

Statistical analysis using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
Compares means across multiple groups in a dataset.


Simple Linear Regression (SLR.ipynb)

Implements simple linear regression on a dataset.
Explores relationships between a single predictor and target variable.


Multiple Linear Regression (MLR1.ipynb)

Implements multiple linear regression.
Analyzes multiple predictors for a target variable.
